# audit_report-2 Fix Check (Static)

Reviewed findings from `.tmp/audit_report-2.md` against current repository state (static-only, no execution).

## Overall
Result: 2 / 2 previously reported issues are fixed based on static evidence.

## Issue-by-Issue Verification

### F-01 (High) - Offline mutation queue replay not deterministically triggered
Previous finding: App did not send `SYNC_QUEUE`; replay depended on SW-side online event only.
Current status: Fixed

Evidence:
- `repo/client/src/main.tsx:19` adds a window online listener that posts `{ type: 'SYNC_QUEUE' }` to the active service worker.
- `repo/client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:75` posts `{ type: 'SYNC_QUEUE' }` immediately after successful login.
- `repo/client/public/sw.js:206` still handles `SYNC_QUEUE` by calling `replayQueue()`.

Conclusion: Deterministic replay triggers now exist at app level (reconnect + post-login), closing the reported wiring gap.

### M-01 (Medium) - Retry attempts could leave stale RUNNING job rows
Previous finding: Scheduler started a new job-run record on retry without finalizing prior attempt, risking stale observability state.
Current status: Fixed

Evidence:
- `repo/server/src/observability/scheduler.service.ts:36` now finalizes previous `runId` on retry.
- `repo/server/src/observability/scheduler.service.ts:39` calls `failJobRun(...)` before creating the next attempt's run.
- `repo/server/src/observability/scheduler.service.ts:47` then starts a fresh run record for the current attempt.

Conclusion: Prior retry attempts are now explicitly closed instead of being left in RUNNING state.

## Notes
This is a static fix check only. Runtime verification (for example, true replay behavior across browsers/network transitions) still requires manual execution.
